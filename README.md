# Image Processing Project

This repository contains a collection of image processing exercises, primarily focused on medical imagery such as X-rays. It includes Jupyter Notebooks that detail various processing techniques, along with a set of sample images used within the notebooks.

## Contents

- `RS_Activida_2doParcial.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook containing the image processing tasks for the second partial exam.
- `imgs/`: A directory with image files used in the notebook:
  - `hueso.png`: An image of a bone.
  - `rayosx.jpg`: An X-ray image.
  - `rodilla.jpg`: An image of a knee.
  - `rodilla.jfif`: Another image of a knee in JFIF format.
- `RS_Images-checkpoint.ipynb`: A checkpoint file for the Jupyter Notebook.
- `ExamenPrimerParcial/`: Directory containing materials for the first partial exam (may include image files and notebooks).

## Prerequisites

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Image processing libraries (such as OpenCV, PIL, or similar) which can be installed using `pip`.

## Usage

The notebooks contain code cells that can be run to perform specific image processing tasks, such as image thresholding, edge detection, and other techniques relevant to the analysis of medical images.
